The motivation for this project was to implement a lecture understanding of the components of HTML while using CSS to mimic the design of a previously designed profile. This project was built as a demonstration of the power of CSS in creating webpage that uses flexbox properties and media queries to style a page that is useful on various screen sizes. I found that advanced CSS is easy with which to make mistakes, and requires much trial and error to achieve any sort of desired result. I had difficulty rendering anchor tags inline, as well as the individual <div> boxes, which is why they still display as a block element on top of one another. This project stands out due to the demonstration of knowledge of various advanced CSS properties. I was able to accomplish all the goals of the project, although the precision will need further attention.
